# RSA

A small python program simulating how [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#Operation) is working using the [tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) [library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) and running on [Python](https://www.python.org/).

[Here](https://tkdocs.com/shipman/) you find the TK documentation and [here](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/index.html) a tutorial.

To execute the program open RSA.py. This is how it looks like:

In the future other encryption methods might be following and possibly the whole project might be changed to use the [ttk widgets of tkinter](https://www.pythontutorial.net/tkinter/tkinter-ttk/).
